## WBGT Calculation Accuracy Notes
    
### Data Sources & Accuracy
| **Parameter**       | **Accuracy**                          | **Source**                          |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Temperature          | Â±1Â°C (stations) / Â±2Â°C (model)       | Ground stations & satellite models  |
| Humidity             | Â±5% RH (station) / Â±10% RH (model)   | Direct measurements & interpolation |
| Wind Speed           | Â±2 m/s (stations) / Â±3 m/s (model)   | Affected by local topography         |
| Solar Radiation      | Â±15% (clear sky) / Â±25% (cloudy)     | GOES-R satellite estimates           |

### Critical WBGT Considerations
1. **Black Globe Temperature Estimation**  
   `Tg = Tair + (SolarRadiation/(200 + 10*WindSpeed))`  
   - Potential error: Â±2Â°C vs actual globe thermometer

2. **Update Frequency**  
   - Data refreshes every 15-60 minutes

3. **Spatial Resolution**  
   - Represents ~10km grid averages

4. **Nighttime Limitations**  
   - Doesn't account for artificial heat sources

### Error Ranges by WBGT Level
| WBGT Range | Potential Error |
|------------|-----------------|
| <27Â°C      | Â±1Â°C            |
| 27-32Â°C    | Â±1.5Â°C          |
| >32Â°C      | Â±2Â°C            |

### When to Trust/Doubt the Data
**High Confidence**  
âœ“ Clear sky daylight hours  
âœ“ Multiple weather stations reporting  
âœ“ Stable weather conditions  

**Low Confidence**  
âœ— Within 2 hours of sunrise/sunset  
âœ— Rapidly changing weather  
âœ— Mountainous/forested terrain  

### Recommendations
- Add Â±2Â°C error margin for safety decisions
- Check `stations` array length in API response
- Flag data older than 30 minutes
- Not for medical/occupational compliance use

*Note: These estimates are for general heat risk awareness only. Always verify with on-site measurements for critical applications.*


**Key Limitations:**
- ðŸ•’ 15-60 minute update delay
- ðŸŒ† Urban heat islands not captured
- ðŸŒ™ Nighttime artificial heat not included
